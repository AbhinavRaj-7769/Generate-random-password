# Generate-random-password using Javascript
This program allows you to generate random passwords with a variety of options, including length, character types, and special characters. It also provides a strength indicator to help you choose a strong password. 

Note: I have started learning web development recently but eager to share my piece of code and improve my knowledge on building logics. 
Suggestions welcome!
